A RECREATION OF 
https://github.com/schteppe/p2.js/blob/master/examples/canvas/asteroids.html

USING REDUX AND REACT (UNNESSESARILY)
WITH WEBSOCKETS FOR MULTIPLAYER
AND MAYBE MORE GAMEPLAY FEATURES

NPM RUN START-DEV to start node-server
NPM RUN BUNDLE to watch and bundle with webpack

DONE:
DROP IN MULTIPLAYER USING WEBSOCKETS
BASIC PHYSICS, WARPING AND SERVER
ADJUSTABLE CONFIG OPTIONS
ASTEROID SPLITS
BULLETS
SHIP COLOR
LEVELS INCREASE INCREASING ASTEROIDS NUMBER AND SPEED
UI, SCORE, SHIP DEATH
MAKE SAUCERS MOVE/SHOOT/AIM
ASTEROID SKINS
SPAWN CHECK

BUGS?

SPAWN CHECK HAS ISSUES... RETHINK (MAYBE ???)
PLAYER ONE SPAWNS IN RIGHT AWAY BUT PLAYER TWO DOESN'T SPAWN UNTIL GAME BEGINS (MAYBE ???)

TODO:
GIVE DEAD PLAYER AN EXTRA LIFE AT THE END OF EACH LEVEL
DONE? APPLY A FORM OF SPAWN CHECK TO ASTEROIDS SO THEY DON'T CLIP AT INCREDIBLE SPEEDS

GAME IS TOO HARD --> GAVE EXTRA LIVES, ADD THIS...
CREATE CUSTOM RULES PER LEVEL

?ADD CUSTOM RULES PER ASTEROID LEVELS
?ADD FINAL BOSS LEVEL
?ADD SHEILDS
?ADD COSMETIC CHANGES TO ACCOMPANY UPGRADES

?RETHINK AND SIMPLIFY GAMESTATE CONTROLLING BOOLEANS/ADD PREGAME LOBBY
?ADD GAME OVER AND GAME RESTART

?ESTABLISH WEB-DEV SKILL AS TO PROCURE MEANINGFUL EMPLOYMENT
WE WILL SEE HOW THINGS Gooo....
